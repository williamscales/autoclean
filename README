Autoclean is a rules-based file cleaner.

Usage:
======

    autoclean [rules file]
    If no rules file is specified, ~/.autocleanrc is read by default.

    -v, --version                    Display current version

The rules file
==============

The rules file is written in YAML <http://www.yaml.org/> and is a list
of hashes.  Each hash is keyed by symbols.

Elements and what they do
-------------------------

:glob:		A shell glob from which the files to be cleaned are pulled.
:condition:	A list with two elements.  The first should specifiy a
		condition (for now only 'age' is supported) and the
		second element should give the expression.  The first
		character of this expression should be eithe '>' or
		'<' and the rest a specification parseable by Chronic
		<http://chronic.rubyforge.org/>.
:action:	The action to be taken on the files, can be either
		'delete' or 'move'.  In the case of 'move' it should
		be an array with the second element containing the
		destination directory.
:unless:	A way to remove files from the list.  Right now the
		only supported operator is 'like' which compares the
		basename of files from :glob to the basename of files
		from a glob specified in the second element.  Designed
		for use with a torrent program, one might pass the
		torrent directory to this operator.
